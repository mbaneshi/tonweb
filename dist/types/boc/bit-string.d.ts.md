It looks like you've shared a TypeScript class definition for a `BitString`. This class appears to represent a string of bits, providing methods for manipulating and working with individual bits, as well as writing various types of data to the bit string.

Here's a brief overview of the class and its methods:

### Class: `BitString`

#### Properties:
- `length`: A mutable property representing the length of the bit string in bits.
- `array`: A `Uint8Array` representing the actual bit string.
- `cursor`: A cursor indicating the current index in the bit string.
- `textEncoder`: An instance of `TextEncoder`.

#### Methods:

1. `getFreeBits(): number`: Returns the number of unfilled bits in the bit-string.
2. `getUsedBits(): number`: Returns the number of filled bits in the bit-string.
3. `getUsedBytes(): number`: Returns the number of bytes actually used by the bit-string (rounded up to a whole byte).
4. `get(index: number): boolean`: Returns the bit value at the specified index.
5. `on(index: number): void`: Sets the bit value to one at the specified index.
6. `off(index: number): void`: Sets the bit value to zero at the specified index.
7. `toggle(index: number): void`: Toggles the bit value at the specified index.
8. `forEach(callback: (bitValue: boolean) => void): void`: Iterates the bit-string and calls the specified callback for each bit.
9. Various methods for writing different data types to the bit-string, including integers, bytes, strings, etc.
10. `clone(): BitString`: Creates a cloned instance of the bit-string.
11. `toString(): string`: Returns the bit-string represented as a HEX-string.
12. `toHex(): string`: Returns the bit-string represented as a HEX-string (like in Fift).
13. `getTopUppedArray(): Uint8Array`: Returns a top-upped array.
14. `setTopUppedArray(bytes: Uint8Array, fulfilledBytes?: boolean): void`: Sets the cell data to match the provided top-upped array.
15. `checkIndexOrThrow(index: number): void`: Checks if the specified index is allowed for the bit string, throws an error in case of overflow.

This class seems to be a utility for handling and manipulating bit strings in a variety of contexts, possibly related to low-level data serialization or binary manipulation.
