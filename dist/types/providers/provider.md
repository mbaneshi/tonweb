provider

It looks like you have a TypeScript class called `HttpProviderUtils` with some static methods related to parsing and handling responses. Additionally, there are some to-do comments indicating areas for improvement, such as refining typing and removing unused functions.

Here's a breakdown of the class and some suggestions for improvement:

```typescript
import BN from 'bn.js';
import { Cell } from '../boc/cell';

/**
 * Utility class for HTTP provider-related operations.
 */
export class HttpProviderUtils {
    /**
     * Parses an object and returns a BN or any value.
     * @param obj - The object to parse.
     * @returns BN or any.
     * @todo Improve typing.
     */
    static parseObject(obj: any): BN | any {
        // Implementation goes here.
    }

    /**
     * Parses a response stack pair and returns a BN, Cell, or any value.
     * @param pair - The response stack pair.
     * @returns BN, Cell, or any.
     * @todo Improve typing.
     */
    static parseResponseStack(pair: [string, any]): BN | Cell | any {
        // Implementation goes here.
    }

    /**
     * Parses a general response and returns any value.
     * @param result - The response to parse.
     * @returns Any value.
     */
    static parseResponse(result: any): any {
        // Implementation goes here.
    }

    /**
     * Constructs an argument in the form of ['num', BN or Number].
     * @param arg - The argument to convert.
     * @returns Argument in the specified format.
     * @todo This function is unused; consider using it or removing it.
     */
    static makeArg(arg: any): ['num', BN | Number] {
        // Implementation goes here.
    }

    /**
     * Constructs an array of arguments in the form of ['num', BN or Number].
     * @param args - The arguments to convert.
     * @returns Array of arguments in the specified format.
     * @todo This function is unused; consider using it or removing it.
     */
    static makeArgs(args: any[]): Array<['num', BN | Number]> {
        // Implementation goes here.
    }
}
```

Suggestions for improvement:

1. **Improve Typing:** Review and enhance the typing for the methods, especially for parameters and return types. Replace `any` with more specific types wherever possible.

2. **Remove Unused Functions:** Consider removing the unused functions (`makeArg` and `makeArgs`) if they are not needed. Unused code can clutter the codebase.

3. **Extract Individual Functions:** As suggested in the to-do comments, consider whether the static methods can be extracted as individual functions. If the class is only used for grouping related functions and there is no shared state, you might consider making these functions standalone instead of part of a class.

4. **Add JSDoc Comments:** Add descriptive JSDoc comments to explain the purpose and usage of each method.

Applying these suggestions will enhance the clarity, maintainability, and usability of your code.

provider util 


It looks like you have a TypeScript class named `HttpProvider` that serves as an HTTP provider for interacting with a TonCenter API. The class has various methods for querying information about addresses, wallets, transactions, blocks, and more.

Here are some suggestions and observations:

1. **Default Host:** You have a default host (`defaultHost`) defined at the module level. It might be a good idea to make it a constant (using `const`) since it's not expected to be reassigned.

```typescript
export const defaultHost = "https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC";
```

2. **Consistent Naming:** Consider using consistent naming conventions across methods. For example, some methods start with "get" (`getAddressInfo`, `getExtendedAddressInfo`, `getWalletInfo`, etc.), while others start with "send" (`sendBoc`). Consistency in naming can make the API more intuitive.

3. **Remove Deprecated Methods:** The `sendQuery` method is marked as deprecated. Consider removing it if it's no longer needed, as deprecated methods can confuse users.

4. **Improve JSDoc Comments:** Add detailed JSDoc comments for each method to describe their purpose, parameters, and return values. This will help developers who use this class understand its functionality.

5. **Consider Using Enums or Constants:** Instead of using raw strings for method names or IDs, consider using enums or constants to make the code more maintainable and less error-prone.

6. **Type Definitions:** Ensure that the types used in the method signatures (`Promise<any>`) are as specific as possible. If there are specific response structures, define corresponding TypeScript interfaces to improve type safety.

7. **Consistent Error Handling:** Ensure consistent error handling across methods. It's a good practice to catch errors and handle them appropriately or propagate them to the calling code.

8. **Consider Method Refactoring:** Some methods, like `call` and `call2`, seem to have similar functionality. Consider refactoring them to reuse common logic, reducing code duplication.

Remember to update the documentation whenever you make changes to the code, especially if it's intended for use by others.
