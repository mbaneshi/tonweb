address

It looks like you've posted a TypeScript code snippet defining a class `Address` along with some related types and methods. Let me provide a brief overview of what this code does:

1. **Import Statement:**
   ```typescript
   import { Workchain } from './workchain';
   ```
   This line imports the `Workchain` class or module from a file named 'workchain' in the same directory.

2. **Type Declarations:**
   ```typescript
   export declare type AddressType = (Address | string);
   ```
   This line declares a type `AddressType` which can be either an instance of the `Address` class or a string.

3. **Address Class:**
   ```typescript
   export class Address {
   ```
   The `Address` class is defined. It seems to have several properties and methods.

   - **Static Method:**
     ```typescript
     static isValid(anyForm: AddressType): boolean;
     ```
     This is a static method named `isValid` that takes an argument of type `AddressType` and returns a boolean. It likely checks whether the provided address is valid.

   - **Properties:**
     ```typescript
     wc: Workchain;
     hashPart: Uint8Array;
     isTestOnly: boolean;
     isUserFriendly: boolean;
     isBounceable: boolean;
     isUrlSafe: boolean;
     ```
     These properties store various aspects of the address, such as the workchain (`wc`), hash part (`hashPart`), and boolean flags indicating whether the address is test-only, user-friendly, bounceable, and URL safe.

   - **Constructor:**
     ```typescript
     constructor(address: AddressType);
     ```
     The class has a constructor that takes an `AddressType` argument (which can be an instance of `Address` or a string). Presumably, the constructor initializes the properties based on the provided address.

   - **Instance Method:**
     ```typescript
     toString(isUserFriendly?: boolean, isUrlSafe?: boolean, isBounceable?: boolean, isTestOnly?: boolean): string;
     ```
     This method generates a string representation of the address. It takes optional boolean parameters that influence the formatting of the output.

   - **Private Methods:**
     ```typescript
     private initFromInstance;
     private initFromString;
     private parseFriendlyAddress;
     private checkWorkchainOrThrow;
     ```
     These are private methods within the class, likely used for internal operations.

The provided code snippet seems to be part of a larger system that involves working with addresses, possibly in the context of a blockchain or distributed ledger. If you have any specific questions or if there's anything specific you'd like assistance with, feel free to ask!

common

This code snippet appears to define several utility functions for working with binary data, encoding/decoding, and cryptographic operations. Here's a brief overview of each function:

1. **sha256:**
   ```typescript
   export declare function sha256(bytes: Uint8Array): Promise<ArrayBuffer>;
   ```

   This function converts an amount from either a `BN` (Big Number) or a string to nanocoins and returns a `BN` representing the converted value.

3. **fromNano:**
   ```typescript
   export declare function fromNano(amount: (BN | string)): string;
   ```
   This function converts an amount from either a `BN` or a string representing nanocoins to a string representing regular coins.

4. **bytesToHex:**
   ```typescript
   export declare function bytesToHex(buffer: Uint8Array): string;
   ```
   Converts a `Uint8Array` of bytes to a hexadecimal string.

5. **hexToBytes:**

   export declare function hexToBytes(hex: string): Uint8Array;
   ```
   Converts a hexadecimal string to a `Uint8Array` of bytes.

6. **stringToBytes:**
   ```typescript
   export declare function stringToBytes(str: string, size?: number): Uint8Array;
   ```
   Converts a string to a `Uint8Array` of bytes, with an optional parameter specifying the size of the output array.

7. **crc32c:**
   ```typescript
   export declare function crc32c(bytes: Uint8Array): Uint8Array;
   ```
   Calculates the CRC32C checksum of a `Uint8Array` of bytes.

8. **crc16:**
   ```typescript
   export declare function crc16(data: ArrayLike<number>): Uint8Array;
   ```
   Calculates the CRC16 checksum of an array-like object of numbers.

9. **concatBytes:**
   ```typescript
   export declare function concatBytes(a: Uint8Array, b: Uint8Array): Uint8Array;
   ```
   Concatenates two `Uint8Array` instances and returns a new `Uint8Array`.

10. **compareBytes:**
    ```typescript
    export declare function compareBytes(a: Uint8Array, b: Uint8Array): boolean;
    ```
    Compares two `Uint8Array` instances for equality.

11. **bytesToBase64:**
    ```typescript
    export declare function bytesToBase64(bytes: Uint8Array): string;
    ```
    Converts a `Uint8Array` of bytes to a base64-encoded string.

12. **base64toString:**
    ```typescript
    export declare function base64toString(base64: string): string;
    ```
    Converts a base64-encoded string to a regular string.

13. **stringToBase64:**
    ```typescript
    export declare function stringToBase64(str: string): string;
    ```
    Converts a string to a base64-encoded string.

14. **base64ToBytes:**
    ```typescript
    export declare function base64ToBytes(base64: string): Uint8Array;
    ```
    Converts a base64-encoded string to a `Uint8Array` of bytes.

15. **readNBytesUIntFromArray:**
    ```typescript
    export declare function readNBytesUIntFromArray(n: number, ui8array: Uint8Array): number;
    ```
    Reads `n` bytes from a `Uint8Array` and interprets them as an unsigned integer.

These functions provide a variety of common operations for working with binary data and cryptographic operations in a TypeScript environment. If you have any specific questions or need more detailed explanations of any of these functions, feel free to ask!

transfer URL 

This code defines an interface `ParsedTransferUrl` and two functions: `parseTransferUrl` and `formatTransferUrl`. Let me break down each part:

1. **Interface - ParsedTransferUrl:**
   ```typescript
   export interface ParsedTransferUrl {
       address: string;
       amount?: string;
       text?: string;
   }
   ```
   This interface defines the structure of an object representing a parsed TON-transfer URL. It has three properties: `address` (required), `amount` (optional), and `text` (optional).

2. **Function - parseTransferUrl:**
   ```typescript
   export declare function parseTransferUrl(url: string): ParsedTransferUrl;
   ```
   This function takes a TON-transfer URL as input and returns an object conforming to the `ParsedTransferUrl` interface. It parses the URL into its individual parts, including the address, amount, and text. If the URL format is invalid, the function may throw an error.

3. **Function - formatTransferUrl:**
   ```typescript
   export declare function formatTransferUrl(address: string, amount?: string, text?: string): string;
   ```
   This function takes individual parts of a TON-transfer (address, amount, and text) and formats them into a TON-transfer URL. The `amount` and `text` parameters are optional. The function returns the formatted URL as a string.

   The function also includes a to-do comment:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Formats TON transfer URL from the specified individual parts.
    *
    * @todo: pass all the parts as a single argument of `ParsedTransferUrl` type
    */
   ```

   The to-do comment suggests that there might be a plan to modify the function to accept a single argument of type `ParsedTransferUrl` instead of individual parameters.

In summary, these functions provide a way to parse and format TON-transfer URLs using TypeScript. The interface `ParsedTransferUrl` defines the expected structure of the parsed URL object, and the functions `parseTransferUrl` and `formatTransferUrl` handle the parsing and formatting logic, respectively.

***

workchain

This TypeScript code snippet defines a type `Workchain` and an enum `WorkchainId`.

1. **Type - Workchain:**
   ```typescript
   export declare type Workchain = (WorkchainId | number);
   ```
   This line declares a type `Workchain` using the `type` keyword. It is a union type that can be either a member of the `WorkchainId` enum or a number. This type is designed to represent workchains, and it allows values to be either specific workchain IDs from the enum or arbitrary numeric values.

2. **Enum - WorkchainId:**
   ```typescript
   export declare enum WorkchainId {
       Master = -1,
       Basic = 0
   }
   ```
   This declares an enum `WorkchainId` with two members: `Master` and `Basic`. Enumerations are a way to define named constant values. In this case, `Master` is assigned the value `-1`, and `Basic` is assigned the value `0`. Enums are useful for improving code readability by providing meaningful names to numeric constants.

Together, these declarations provide a way to represent and work with different workchains in a TypeScript application. The `Workchain` type allows for flexibility in accepting either specific enum values or numeric workchain IDs.
