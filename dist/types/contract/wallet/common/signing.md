It looks like you've posted a TypeScript declaration for a function named `writeTimestampToSigningMessage`. This function seems to take two parameters: `message` of type `Cell` and `seqno` of type `number`. The purpose of the function is to write the current timestamp to the specified signing message if the `seqno` value is not equal to zero; otherwise, it writes a placeholder value.

Here's a breakdown of the function signature:

- `message: Cell`: This parameter represents a `Cell` object, and it's likely that the function will perform some operations related to signing on this object.

- `seqno: number`: This parameter is a number representing the sequence number. If `seqno` is equal to zero, the function is expected to write a placeholder value; otherwise, it should write the current timestamp.

The actual implementation of the function is not provided in the code snippet you posted. If you need further assistance or have specific questions about the implementation, feel free to ask!
