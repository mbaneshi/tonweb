contarct wallet v3 

It looks like you've shared a TypeScript code snippet that defines a class `WalletV3ContractBase` extending `WalletContract<WalletV3ContractOptions>`. This class seems to be related to a wallet contract, possibly for some blockchain or decentralized application.

Let me break down the key components of your code:

1. **Imports:**
   - You're importing `Cell` from `'../../../boc/cell'`.
   - You're importing `WalletContract` and `WalletContractOptions` from `'../wallet-contract'`.

2. **Interface:**
   - There's an interface `WalletV3ContractOptions` that extends `WalletContractOptions` and adds an optional property `walletId` of type `number`.

3. **Class:**
   - The class `WalletV3ContractBase` extends `WalletContract<WalletV3ContractOptions>`, meaning it inherits from `WalletContract` and is specialized with the `WalletV3ContractOptions` type.
   - The class has two protected methods: `createSigningMessage` and `createDataCell`.
   - `createSigningMessage` takes optional parameters `seqno` and `expireAt` and returns a `Cell` object.
   - `createDataCell` is a protected method that returns a `Cell` object.

Without the complete context of your application or the rest of the code, it's a bit challenging to provide more detailed insights. If you have specific questions or if there's anything specific you'd like assistance with, feel free to provide more details!

This TypeScript code defines a class named `WalletV3ContractR1` that extends `WalletV3ContractBase`. Let me break down the key components:

1. **Imports:**
   - It imports `HttpProvider` from `'../../../providers/http-provider'`.
   - It imports `WalletV3ContractBase` and `WalletV3ContractOptions` from `'./wallet-v3-contract-base'`.

2. **Class:**
   - The class `WalletV3ContractR1` extends `WalletV3ContractBase`.
   - The constructor takes two parameters:
     - `provider`: An instance of `HttpProvider`.
     - `options`: An object of type `WalletV3ContractOptions` that likely contains configuration options for the wallet contract.
   - The class implements a method `getName()` that returns a string.

This class seems to be a specific implementation or version (`R1`) of the `WalletV3ContractBase`. It might contain additional or specialized functionality compared to its base class.

If you have any specific questions or if there's anything else you'd like assistance with regarding this code, feel free to ask!

It looks like you have another class definition, `WalletV3ContractR2`, similar to the previous one (`WalletV3ContractR1`). Let's break down the key points:

1. **Imports:**
   - It imports `HttpProvider` from `'../../../providers/http-provider'`.
   - It imports `WalletV3ContractBase` and `WalletV3ContractOptions` from `'./wallet-v3-contract-base'`.

2. **Class:**
   - The class `WalletV3ContractR2` extends `WalletV3ContractBase`.
   - The constructor takes two parameters:
     - `provider`: An instance of `HttpProvider`.
     - `options`: An object of type `WalletV3ContractOptions` that likely contains configuration options for the wallet contract.
   - The class implements a method `getName()` that returns a string.

Based on the provided code, `WalletV3ContractR2` seems to be another version or implementation of the `WalletV3ContractBase`. Each version (R1, R2, etc.) may have specific functionalities or configurations, but they share common features defined in the base class (`WalletV3ContractBase`).
