r1

It looks like you've posted a TypeScript class named `SimpleWalletContractR1` that extends `WalletContract`. Let's break down the important components of this class:

1. **Import Statements:**
   - The class imports `HttpProvider` from `'../../../providers/http-provider'`.
   - It also imports `WalletContract` and `WalletContractOptions` from some location not specified in the provided code snippet.

2. **Class Declaration:**
   - `SimpleWalletContractR1` is declared as a class that extends `WalletContract`. This means it inherits properties and methods from `WalletContract`.

3. **Constructor:**
   - The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `provider` of type `HttpProvider` and `options` of type `WalletContractOptions`.
   - It seems like an instance of `SimpleWalletContractR1` requires an HTTP provider and options specific to `WalletContract`.

4. **Method:**
   - The class defines a method named `getName()` that returns a string. This method is marked with the `declare` keyword, which means that it's informing the TypeScript compiler that this method will be implemented by derived classes or external code, and there's no actual implementation in this class.

5. **Comments:**
   - There's a comment indicating that there is no `seqno` get-method in this wallet. It serves as a note or warning for developers who might be working with this class.

Without the complete code for `WalletContract` and its dependencies, it's challenging to provide more context. If you have specific questions or if there's anything specific you would like to know about this code, feel free to ask!

r2

This TypeScript class, `SimpleWalletContractR2`, appears to be similar to the previously discussed `SimpleWalletContractR1`. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Import Statements:**
   - Imports `HttpProvider` from `'../../../providers/http-provider'`.
   - Imports `ContractOptions` from `'../../contract'`.
   - Imports `WalletContract` from `'../wallet-contract'`.

2. **Class Declaration:**
   - Declares a class named `SimpleWalletContractR2` that extends `WalletContract`. This means it inherits properties and methods from the `WalletContract` class.

3. **Constructor:**
   - The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `provider` of type `HttpProvider` and `options` of type `ContractOptions`.
   - This class, like the previous one, requires an HTTP provider and contract options.

4. **Method:**
   - Defines a method named `getName()` that returns a string. This method is marked with the `declare` keyword, indicating that the method's implementation is not provided in this class.

This class seems to be related to handling wallet contracts, and it extends a base class (`WalletContract`). The usage of `HttpProvider` and `ContractOptions` suggests that it involves some form of communication with an HTTP provider and includes contract-related options.

r3

The `SimpleWalletContractR3` class seems to follow a similar pattern to the previous classes you've shared. Let's break it down:

1. **Import Statements:**
   - Imports `HttpProvider` from `'../../../providers/http-provider'`.
   - Imports `ContractOptions` from `'../../contract'`.
   - Imports `WalletContract` from `'../wallet-contract'`.

2. **Class Declaration:**
   - Declares a class named `SimpleWalletContractR3` that extends `WalletContract`. This implies that `SimpleWalletContractR3` inherits properties and methods from the `WalletContract` class.

3. **Constructor:**
   - The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `provider` of type `HttpProvider` and `options` of type `ContractOptions`.
   - Similar to the previous classes, it requires an HTTP provider and contract options.

4. **Method:**
   - Defines a method named `getName()` that returns a string. Like in the previous examples, this method is marked with the `declare` keyword, indicating that the implementation is not provided in this class.

Given the similarities with the previous classes, it seems like these classes are part of a hierarchy related to wallet contracts. They share a common structure and functionality, with the specific details potentially varying based on the versions (`R1`, `R2`, `R3`).
