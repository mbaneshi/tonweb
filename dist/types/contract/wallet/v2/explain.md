wallet-v2-contract-base.d.ts

It looks like you've provided TypeScript code for a class named `WalletV2ContractBase` that extends another class named `WalletContract`. This code seems to be part of a larger project, likely related to blockchain or wallet functionality, given the presence of classes such as `Cell` and `WalletContract`.

Let me break down the provided code:

```typescript
import { Cell } from '../../../boc/cell';
import { WalletContract } from '../wallet-contract';

export declare class WalletV2ContractBase extends WalletContract {
    protected createSigningMessage(seqno?: number, expireAt?: number): Cell;
}
```

1. **Imports:**
   - `Cell` is imported from the `'../../../boc/cell'` module.
   - `WalletContract` is imported from the `'../wallet-contract'` module.

2. **Class Declaration:**
   - `WalletV2ContractBase` is declared as a class using the `class` keyword.
   - It extends (`extends`) the `WalletContract` class.

3. **Method Declaration:**
   - The class has a protected method named `createSigningMessage`.
   - This method takes two optional parameters, `seqno` and `expireAt`, both of type `number`.
   - The method returns an object of type `Cell`.

The purpose of this class seems to be related to creating a signing message for some sort of wallet functionality, possibly in a blockchain context. The specifics would depend on the implementation of the `createSigningMessage` method and the functionality provided by the `WalletContract` class.

If you have any specific questions or if you need further clarification about any part of the code, feel free to ask!

This TypeScript code defines a class named `WalletV2ContractR1`, which extends the previously mentioned `WalletV2ContractBase` class. Let's break down the code:

```typescript
import { HttpProvider } from '../../../providers/http-provider';
import { ContractOptions } from '../../contract';
import { WalletV2ContractBase } from './wallet-v2-contract-base';

export declare class WalletV2ContractR1 extends WalletV2ContractBase {
    constructor(provider: HttpProvider, options: ContractOptions);
    getName(): string;
}
```

1. **Imports:**
   - `HttpProvider` is imported from the `'../../../providers/http-provider'` module.
   - `ContractOptions` is imported from the `'../../contract'` module.
   - `WalletV2ContractBase` is imported from the `'./wallet-v2-contract-base'` module, which appears to be the base class defined in your previous code.

2. **Class Declaration:**
   - `WalletV2ContractR1` is declared as a class using the `class` keyword.
   - It extends (`extends`) the `WalletV2ContractBase` class.

3. **Constructor:**
   - The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `provider` of type `HttpProvider` and `options` of type `ContractOptions`.
   - The constructor likely initializes the instance of `WalletV2ContractR1` with the provided `provider` and `options`.

4. **Method Declaration:**
   - The class has a method named `getName()` that takes no parameters and returns a string (`: string`).

The purpose of this class seems to be to extend the functionality provided by `WalletV2ContractBase`, possibly with additional features specific to the version represented by `WalletV2ContractR1`. The `getName` method is declared, but its actual implementation details would depend on the specific requirements of your application or project.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

The code you provided is similar to the one for `WalletV2ContractR1`, with the only difference being the class name (`WalletV2ContractR2`). Let's break down the code:

```typescript
import { HttpProvider } from '../../../providers/http-provider';
import { ContractOptions } from '../../contract';
import { WalletV2ContractBase } from './wallet-v2-contract-base';

export declare class WalletV2ContractR2 extends WalletV2ContractBase {
    constructor(provider: HttpProvider, options: ContractOptions);
    getName(): string;
}
```

1. **Imports:**
   - `HttpProvider` is imported from the `'../../../providers/http-provider'` module.
   - `ContractOptions` is imported from the `'../../contract'` module.
   - `WalletV2ContractBase` is imported from the `'./wallet-v2-contract-base'` module, which is likely the base class.

2. **Class Declaration:**
   - `WalletV2ContractR2` is declared as a class using the `class` keyword.
   - It extends (`extends`) the `WalletV2ContractBase` class.

3. **Constructor:**
   - The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `provider` of type `HttpProvider` and `options` of type `ContractOptions`.
   - The constructor likely initializes the instance of `WalletV2ContractR2` with the provided `provider` and `options`.

4. **Method Declaration:**
   - The class has a method named `getName()` that takes no parameters and returns a string (`: string`).

Just like `WalletV2ContractR1`, `WalletV2ContractR2` extends the functionality provided by `WalletV2ContractBase` and includes a method named `getName`. The actual implementation details of these classes and methods would depend on the specific requirements of your application or project.
